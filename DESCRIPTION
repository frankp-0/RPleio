Description: This package represents our attempt to reimplement the PLEIO hypothesis testing procedure of Lee et al. (2021) in R. It omits a number of features, such as p-value flattening, visualization, and effect size standardization. Our goal was simply to port the variance component test and importance sampling procedure to R for our own edification and in fulfillment of the final project for a statistical computing course.
